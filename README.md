def factorial(n)
  if n == 0
    return 1

  end
end

# Test the factorial function
puts "Factorial of 5 is #{factorial(5)}"


with backticks (which is correct)

```
def factorial(n)
  if n == 0
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Test the factorial function
puts "Factorial of 5 is #{factorial(5)}"
